# Game of Life

A proof-of-concept implementation of Conway's Game of Life, pushing the limits of React, TypeScript, and Vite.

This project intentionally uses a naive approach, rendering each cell as a separate DOM element. Do not use this in production. For a performant implementation, consider using a canvas or a library optimized for rendering large grids.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Start with `npm run dev`
